Hi, I am Revathi Prabhala a software engineer that's also trying to become a machine learning engineer. As a beginner in the world of machine learning and data science, I am currently contributing to mutliple open source projects. I am also pursuing a Udacity nanodegree course in deep learning for hands on learning.
In my downtime, my interest lies in pursuing music and dragging myself to the gym every morning.
