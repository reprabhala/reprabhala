Hi, I am Revathi Prabhala a data scientist with a strong programming background. At work, I contribute to defect detection, key metrology parameter prediction, pipeline creation and data analysis. I try to utilise my time on GitHub to explore other areas of prediction and to contribute to open source projects.
In my downtime, my interest lies in pursuing music and dragging myself to the gym every morning.
